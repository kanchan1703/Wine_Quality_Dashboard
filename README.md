# Wine Quality Dashboard
<br/>
I have created a dashboard, an interactive visualization and insights about the Wine Quality dataset. With the help of the dashboard, we can clearly understand the relationship between various chemical properties that affect the quality ratings of the wines.
<br/>
**A little bit about the Wine dataset:** <br/>

I have used the Wine Quality dataset, which contains chemical properties of the red and white wines with varying qualities. The dataset consists of various attributes, like:
<br/>
Initially, I did the basic **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** operations on the dataset to make it suitable to create a dashboard. Also, understood the data well and found out the attributes highly correlated to the quality of the wines. Some of these attributes are: Alcohol content, Density, Citric Acid, Free Sulphur Dioxide, Sulphates, and Volatile Acidity.
<br/>
 The visualizations that I have included in the dashboard include:
 1. Distribution of Wine Quality scores
 2. Correlation between alcohol content and quality
 3. Comparative Analysis of Red and White Wines
 4. Relation between the key factors affecting Wine Quality

Note for the reader:<br/>
You can download the .pbix file and open it in Power BI. You can interact with the visualizations by clicking on the charts and using filters.
